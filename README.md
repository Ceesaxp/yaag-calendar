# Year-At-A-Glance (YAAG) Calendar

The Year Planner is a high-level visual planning tool that provides a comprehensive annual view of events, holidays, and recurring commitments in a single interface. Unlike traditional calendar applications that focus on detailed day or week views, the Year Planner emphasizes the macro-level time organization across an entire year.
