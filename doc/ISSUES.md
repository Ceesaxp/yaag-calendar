# YAAG Calendar: Identified Issues and Improvements

## Rendering and Visual Issues

1. **Multi-segment Event Styling Inconsistency**
   - When events span across multiple weeks, the continuation indicators (arrows) may not be visible enough, especially in smaller viewport sizes
   - Middle segments (with ellipsis) might not clearly indicate they're part of the same event as the start/end segments

2. **Event Positioning Edge Cases**
   - Events that span exactly one week might not display correctly when they start on Sunday and end on Saturday
   - There's a potential issue with the positioning calculation when events span month boundaries at the end of a month with fewer days

3. **Hover State Coordination**
   - When hovering over one segment of a multi-segment event, all segments highlight, but there's a slight delay causing a visual flicker
   - The hover effect might not be visible enough to indicate that segments are related

## Algorithmic Issues

1. **Caching Limitations**
   - The current caching implementation in EventPositionCalculator doesn't account for changes to events after they've been cached
   - Cache invalidation isn't properly handled when events are updated or deleted

2. **Swim Lane Allocation Inefficiency**
   - The algorithm for finding available swim lanes always searches lanes sequentially, which can lead to inefficient space usage when there are many events
   - When many segments need the same swim lane, it forces events into higher lanes unnecessarily

3. **Recurrence Pattern Edge Cases**
   - Events that recur on month boundaries (e.g., 31st of each month) will be inconsistently positioned since some months don't have a 31st day
   - Weekly recurring events that span multiple days don't properly consider week boundaries

## Performance Concerns

1. **DOM Element Proliferation**
   - Creating separate DOM elements for each segment of multi-day events multiplies the number of elements significantly, which could impact performance with many events
   - Consider using a canvas-based approach for rendering or optimizing element creation

2. **Calculation Overhead**
   - The segment calculation for complex events is computationally expensive, especially when there are many recurring events
   - The position calculation runs on each render, which could be optimized to run only when necessary

## User Experience Issues

1. **Limited Multi-segment Event Interaction**
   - Clicking any segment of a multi-segment event opens the same editor, but there's no visual indication of this behavior
   - No way to select a specific day within a multi-day event when editing

2. **Month Boundary Visibility**
   - Events spanning months aren't visually distinct enough at month boundaries
   - No clear indication when an event continues into the next month vs. ends at month boundary

3. **Long Events Readability**
   - For events spanning many weeks or months, the title is only shown in the first segment, making it hard to identify the event in later segments
   - Date range information could be more prominently displayed in each segment

## Browser Compatibility and Responsive Design

1. **Print Layout Issues**
   - The current print styles don't properly handle page breaks for multi-segment events
   - Event colors might not print correctly on some browsers/printers

2. **Mobile View Limitations**
   - The horizontal scrolling on mobile devices makes it difficult to view the entire year
   - Consider a different layout for mobile that focuses on quarters or months rather than the entire year

## Accessibility Concerns

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Limited keyboard navigation support for moving between days and events
   - No keyboard shortcuts for common actions (add event, navigate between months)

2. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Event segments don't have proper ARIA attributes to indicate their relationship
   - Missing role attributes and proper labeling for interactive elements

## Suggested Enhancements

1. **Segment Rendering**
   - Add clearer visual indicators for event continuations across weeks/months
   - Implement a more distinctive styling for different segments of the same event

2. **Algorithm Improvements**
   - Optimize the swim lane allocation algorithm to better utilize available space
   - Improve caching mechanism to handle event updates properly

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement virtual rendering for events outside the viewport
   - Optimize DOM manipulation by batching updates and minimizing reflows

4. **UX Enhancements**
   - Add tooltips showing full event details when hovering over any segment
   - Implement drag-and-drop for resizing events and moving them between days
